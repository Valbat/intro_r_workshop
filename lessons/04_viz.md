Visualizing data is an area where R really shines.  We are going to again take a split approach.  I will show some quick and easy graphics that we can produce with base R, but we won't spend anytime customizing them. Instead, we will move on quickly to `ggplot2`, which is now (I have no data to back this up), the de-facto standard for visualizing data in R.  We have only a very short time to
spend on this, but hopefully it will provide enough of a foundation for future learning.

## Lesson Outline:

## Lesson Exercises:

##Simple plots with base R
Exploratory data analysis tends to be a little bit about stats and a lot about visualization.  Later we are going to go into more detail on `ggplot2` which is becoming the gold standard of viz in R, but for now we will look at some of the simple, yet very useful, plots that come with base R.  I find these to be great ways to quickly explore data.  

The workhorse function for plotting data in R is `plot()`.  With this one command you can create almost any plot you can conceive of, but for this workshop we are just going to look at the very basics of the function.  The most common way to use `plot()` is for scatterplots.  Let's look at the `mtcars` data.
