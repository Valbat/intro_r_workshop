# R Basics

In this first lesson we are going to go over the very basics of R, cover some 
basic terminology, talk a little about syntax and point you to resources for 
getting help.

##Working with R and RStudio
Over the last several years, RStudio has become a very popular IDE (integrated 
development environment) for R.  In addition to interacting with the R Console, 
RStudio has many extras built in including version control integration, package 
building, reproducible research, de-bugging, and built-in text editor with smart 
highlighting and code completion.  This is the environment we will be using for 
the workshop and should set you up for continued learning with R.

##Exercise 1.1
This exercise will make sure R and RStudio are working and that you can get 
around the basics in RStudio.  Use the green stickies when you have completed, 
and red stickies if you are running into problems.

1. Start RStudio: To start both R and RStudio requires only firing up RStudio.  
RStudio should be available from All Programs at the Start Menu.  Fire up 
RStudio. 

2. Take a few minutes to look around RStudio.  Find the Console Pane. Find 
Global and Project Options (hint: look in Tools).  Look at the Environment, 
History Pane.  Look at the Files, Plots, Packages, etc. pane.

3. Create a new project.  Name it "intro_r_workshop".  We will use this for the 
rest of the workshop.

4. Create a new "R Script"" in the Source Pane, save that file into your newly 
created project and name it "lesson1.R".
