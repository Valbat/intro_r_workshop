# Basic Data Wrangling with R

Data wrangling (manipulation, jujitsu, cleaning, etc.) is the part of any data
analysis that will take the most time.  While it may not necessarily be fun, it
is foundational to all the work that follows.  For this workshop we are just 
going to cover the bare essentialls of working with data frames in R.  If there
is time, we will show a bit of Hadley Wickham's `dplyr` package.

## Lesson Outline:

- [Indexing vectors](#indexing-vectors)
- [Indexing lists](#indexing-lists)
- [Indexing data frames](#indexing-data-frames)
- [`dplyr`](#dplyr)

## Lesson Exercises:

- [Exercise 3.2](#exercise-32)
- [Exercise 3.3](#exercise-33)
- [Exercise 3.4](#exercise-34)
